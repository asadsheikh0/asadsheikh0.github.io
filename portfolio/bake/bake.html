                        <p>This project in Programming Usable Interfaces was about
                            creating a website for a business that encouraged user
                            interaction. I chose to create a website for Bun Bun Bake
                            Shop, a fictitious local bakery in Pittsburgh that sold
                            delicious cinnamon rolls with a variety of flavors and glazings.

                        <p>At the start of this project, in class we were first tasked
                            with coming up with low-fidelity paper prototypes which
                            we then shared with classmates.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a part of my first design, I decided to use a grid-based
                            layout to display the variety of cinnamon roll flavors. As
                            I user-tested this prototype, clicks on a particular flavor
                            would then direct the user to choose more details about
                            their order - choosing their preferred glazing and quantity,
                            and then adding their order to the cart.
                        </p>
                        <p>After my first round of testing, I received feedback to 
                            include a back button in case the user makes a mistake
                            and needs to go back and to keep the continuity of the
                            bar menu at the top of the page so that the user could
                            easily navigate through the site, regardless of what
                            page they were on. These changes are reflected in the
                            second iteration, shown to the right of the first iteration.
                        </p>

                        <p>After the first iteration of changes, we then had to 
                            test again on our revisions. Meeting up with another classmate, 
                            I then had them perform
                            the same task I had my first tester perform but with my
                            modified prototype. After the test, I got some more valuable
                            feedback which I then incorporated into my next iteration.
                        </p>
                        <p>This time, I received feedback saying that I should 
                            include a semantic indicator of what the arrow at the bottom of the first page
                            meant - scroll. Another thing I received feedback on was that it
                            wasn't clear if a user could add multiple of one flavor but with 
                            different quanities or glazings.
                        </p>
                        <p>After hearing this feedback, I then included an intermediate
                            order page that would display the current item the user
                            was planning to add on their cart for each flavor. That way,
                            a user would be able to add multiple items to their cart
                            of the same flavor but with various quantities and glazings.

                        <p>After iterating with a few paper prototypes, I then 
                            began to develop a higher-fidelity prototype of the
                            website. I worked in Figma to create a site map of 
                            all the different pages that I wanted to include as 
                            well as including the user flow between pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>In terms of my final design decisions, I decided to first 
                            allow the users to navigate to a products page where they can pick a
                            flavor that they want to buy as that is the primary 
                            grouping principle for ordering these
                            cinnamon rolls. Once they select a flavor, they can 
                            then select a quantity and a glazing and
                            add it to their order. The order does not add it straight 
                            to the cart so that users can order 
                            multiple of the same flavor but with different glaze 
                            without being sent back to the flavor
                            selection screen. Thus, once the user finished coming 
                            up with orders of a flavor, they then
                            confirm their selections and add the intermediate 
                            order to the cart. Once they navigate to
                            the cart, they can then choose their shipping method, 
                            either to their home address or pick
                            it up in the store. After that, they can then input 
                            their payment details before pressing
                            submit and then receiving their wonderful and 
                            delicious cinnamon rolls.

                        <p>After creating a higher-fidelity prototype, we then
                            began the process of translating our designs into
                            HTML and CSS. This part of the process was particularly
                            difficult for me, as I had no prior experience with 
                            either HTML or CSS, so it took a lot of time to get 
                            working.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, we were not allowed to use any frameworks
                            such as Bootstrap, so getting everything to align
                            together was a lot of work, but it all worked out in the end!
